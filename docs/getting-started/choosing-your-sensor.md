## Decision guide

### Choose Grillo One if:

- You have reliable WiFi or Ethernet at your location
- The sensor will be installed indoors
- You want the simplest setup experience
- You don't need cellular connectivity

### Choose Grillo Pulse if:

- You need to deploy in a location without WiFi
- The installation may be outdoors
- You need battery backup for power outages
- You want flexibility to relocate the sensor

## Can I use both?

Yes! Many networks combine both sensor types:

- **Grillo One** sensors at fixed indoor locations (offices, schools)
- **Grillo Pulse** sensors at remote or outdoor sites

Both sensor types work seamlessly together in the same network on Grillo Cloud.

## Still unsure?

If you're not sure which sensor is right for your deployment:

1. Consider your **connectivity options** - Do you have reliable WiFi/Ethernet?
2. Consider your **installation environment** - Indoor or outdoor?
3. Consider your **power reliability** - Do you need battery backup?
