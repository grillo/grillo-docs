# Grillo Docs Site
This site is built using the static site generator refer to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

The docs area consists of markdown pages, and the front page (or other pages) uses react. Instructions on how to create either page are found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides).

## First time installation
First time you install this, use:

```npm install```

```npm install --save @docusaurus/theme-mermaid```

## Run development server
To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes. 
 
```
npm run start
```

## Deploy to Github Pages
This is now done automatically via Github Actions. Just have your PR accepted, or push directly to main branch, and Github will build and publish the pages.


## Updating your Docusaurus version
