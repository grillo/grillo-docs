# Hardware Overview

Grillo offers two sensor models designed for different deployment scenarios. Both sensors use high-quality MEMS accelerometers to detect ground motion and stream data in real-time to the Grillo Cloud.

## Grillo One

The Grillo One is a strong motion sensor designed for fixed indoor installations. It uses a low-noise MEMS accelerometer to capture vibrations and ground shaking from small to strong events.

**Key features:**
- Low-noise MEMS accelerometer (3 channels)
- WiFi and Ethernet connectivity
- Compact design for indoor use
- Captures small to strong ground motion

## Grillo Pulse

The Grillo Pulse adds cellular connectivity and is designed for remote or field deployments. It combines the same low-noise MEMS accelerometer as the Grillo One with a vertical geophone, providing 4 channels of seismic data capable of capturing micro-seismic events up to strong shaking.

**Key features:**
- Low-noise MEMS accelerometer + vertical geophone (4 channels)
- Captures micro-seismic to strong ground motion
- WiFi and cellular (LTE) connectivity
- Battery backup for power outages
- Weather-resistant design
