# Grillo Docs Site
This site is built using the static site generator refer to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

The docs area consists of markdown pages, and the front page (or other pages) uses react. Instructions on how to create either page are found [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides).

## Run development server

```npm install```

```npm install --save @docusaurus/theme-mermaid```

```
npm run start
```
