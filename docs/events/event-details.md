## Understanding uncertainties

### Location uncertainty

Shown as an error ellipse on the map:
- Semi-major axis length
- Semi-minor axis length
- Orientation

Smaller ellipse = more confident location.

### Magnitude uncertainty

Expressed as ± value:
- M 4.2 ±0.2 means likely between 4.0-4.4
- Uncertainty decreases with more stations

### Why uncertainties vary

| Factor | Effect on uncertainty |
|--------|----------------------|
| More stations | Lower uncertainty |
| Better distribution | Lower uncertainty |
| Higher magnitude | Lower uncertainty |
| Station noise | Higher uncertainty |
