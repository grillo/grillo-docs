# Add Grillo Sensors
Grillo sensors can be easily connected to the Grillo Console with a few clicks.

## Connect your device
First, you will want your device to be connected to the cloud. This is done by powering it on and waiting until the onboard LEDs start blinking every second.
Now you are ready to activate it.

## Add to Grillo Console
Once you are logged in, go to the `Stations` tab in the app, and click on `Add Station` button.

Here you can confirm that the deviceID (`Mac Address`), as printed on your sensor, is the same one that is being shown.
