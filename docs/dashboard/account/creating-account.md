## Multiple accounts

### Can I have multiple accounts?

Each email address can only be associated with one Grillo account. However:

- You can belong to multiple organizations with one account
- Social logins (Google/Microsoft) create accounts linked to those emails

### Switching organizations

If you're a member of multiple organizations:

1. Click on your organization name in the navigation
2. Select a different organization from the dropdown
3. The dashboard will switch to that organization's view

## Troubleshooting

### "Email already registered"

This email is already associated with an account:

1. Try signing in instead of signing up
2. Use "Forgot password" if needed
3. If you used Google/Microsoft before, try that method

### Can't sign in with Google/Microsoft

1. Ensure you're using the same account you signed up with
2. Try clearing your browser cache
3. Check that third-party cookies are enabled
4. Try a different browser

### Account locked

After too many failed login attempts:

1. Wait 15-30 minutes before trying again
2. Use "Forgot password" to reset credentials
3. Contact support if the issue persists
