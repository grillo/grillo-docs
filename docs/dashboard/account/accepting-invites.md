# Accepting Invites

You can join existing organizations in Grillo Cloud by accepting an invitation from an organization administrator.

## How invitations work

1. An organization admin sends you an invite to your email
2. You receive an email with an invitation link
3. You click the link to accept
4. You join the organization with the assigned role

## Receiving an invitation

### Invitation email

When someone invites you to their organization, you'll receive an email containing:

- The name of the organization
- Who invited you
- Your assigned role
- A link to accept the invitation

:::tip
If you don't see the invitation email, check your spam/junk folder.

## Accepting an invitation

### If you already have a Grillo account

1. Click the **"Accept Invitation"** link in the email
2. Sign in with your existing credentials
3. You'll be added to the organization automatically
4. The dashboard will show your new organization

### If you don't have an account yet

1. Click the **"Accept Invitation"** link in the email
2. You'll be prompted to create an account
3. Choose your sign-up method (Google, Microsoft, or email)
4. Complete the account creation process
5. You'll be automatically added to the organization

## After accepting

Once you've accepted an invitation:

### Check your role

Your role determines what you can do in the organization:

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| User | View data, add and configure sensors |

If you belong to multiple organizations:

1. Click on the organization name in the navigation
2. Select the organization you want to view
3. The dashboard will switch contexts

## Managing invitations

### Pending invitations

You may have pending invitations if:
- You received an invite but haven't accepted it
- The invite link expired

To view pending invitations:
1. Sign in to your account
2. Check for a notifications icon or "Invitations" section
3. Accept or decline pending invites

### Declining an invitation

If you don't want to join an organization:
- Simply don't click the acceptance link
- Or look for a "Decline" option in the email
- The invitation will eventually expire

### Invitation expiration

Invitations typically expire after:
<!-- TODO: Confirm expiration time -->
- 7 days from when they were sent
- The sender can resend if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Invitation link doesn't work

1. **Link expired** - Ask the sender to send a new invitation
2. **Already accepted** - Try signing in; you may already be a member
3. **Wrong email** - Ensure you're signed in with the invited email

### Wrong role assigned

If you were assigned the wrong role:
1. Contact the organization admin
2. They can change your role in member settings
3. [See Managing Members](/dashboard/organizations/managing-members)

### Can't find the organization

After accepting, if you don't see the organization:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check the organization switcher dropdown
3. Sign out and sign back in
4. Contact the admin who invited you

### Invited to wrong email

If the invitation went to the wrong email address:
1. Contact the organization admin
2. Ask them to cancel the old invite
3. Request a new invitation to your correct email

## Leaving an organization

If you want to leave an organization you've joined:

1. Navigate to the organization settings
2. Look for "Leave organization" option
3. Confirm your choice

:::warning
Leaving an organization removes your access to all networks and data in that organization.
