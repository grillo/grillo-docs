# Physical Installation - Grillo Pulse

The Grillo Pulse is designed for versatile deployment including outdoor and remote locations. This guide covers installation best practices.

## Choosing a location

### Ideal locations

- **Ground level** - Best for detecting ground motion
- **Solid foundation** - Concrete, bedrock, or stable soil
- **Clear sky view** - For cellular signal (if using cellular)
- **Away from vibrations** - Far from machinery, roads, generators
- **Accessible for maintenance** - But secure from tampering

### Outdoor considerations

- **Drainage** - Avoid areas that collect water
- **Sun exposure** - Some shade is beneficial
- **Wind** - Sheltered locations reduce noise
- **Security** - Consider tamper-resistant mounting

### Locations to avoid

- **Near machinery** - Generators, pumps, HVAC
- **Soft or unstable ground** - Sand, loose soil without foundation
- **Flood-prone areas** - Even with IP rating
- **High-traffic areas** - Vibration from vehicles/people
- **Dense foliage** - Can block cellular signal

## Orientation

The Grillo Pulse should be installed level for accurate readings:

<!-- TODO: Replace with actual orientation diagram -->

- **Level** - Use a bubble level to ensure horizontal placement
- **Stable** - Should not move or rock when touched
- **Antenna** - Position for best cellular reception (if applicable)

## Mounting options

### Option 1: Ground mounting (Recommended for best data)

Direct installation on a solid surface:

1. Select a flat, stable location on concrete or bedrock
2. Clean the mounting surface
3. Attach the mounting plate using appropriate anchors
4. Secure the sensor to the mounting plate
5. Verify level and stability
6. Connect power and antenna

**Best for:** Permanent installations with solid foundation

### Option 2: Pole mounting

For locations without suitable ground surface:

1. Select a sturdy pole or post (metal or wood)
2. Attach the pole mounting bracket at desired height
3. Secure the sensor to the bracket
4. Route cables along the pole
5. Verify stability and level
6. Connect power and antenna

**Best for:** Remote sites, fence lines, temporary deployments

### Option 3: Wall mounting

For building-attached installations:

1. Select a solid exterior wall (avoid hollow structures)
2. Mark and drill mounting holes
3. Install appropriate anchors
4. Attach the mounting bracket
5. Secure the sensor
6. Verify level and stability

**Best for:** Building perimeters, semi-outdoor locations

## Antenna placement

For cellular connectivity, antenna placement affects signal quality:

### Best practices

- **Height** - Higher placement generally improves reception
- **Orientation** - Vertical orientation is typically best
- **Obstructions** - Keep clear of metal objects
- **Separation** - Maintain distance from power cables

### Antenna mounting options

1. **Direct attachment** - Screw into sensor port
2. **Remote mounting** - Use extension cable to position antenna optimally
3. **Pole mounting** - Attach to top of mounting pole

## Weatherproofing

The Grillo Pulse is designed for outdoor use, but proper installation ensures longevity:

### Cable entry

- Use provided cable glands for all connections
- Ensure glands are tight but not overtightened
- Apply outdoor-rated sealant if needed

### Drainage

- Mount with slight tilt to allow water runoff
- Ensure no water can pool on or around device
- Keep drainage holes clear

### UV protection

- Device housing is UV-resistant
- Avoid unnecessary direct sun exposure
- Consider a sun shade for extreme climates

## Power considerations

### AC power

- Use outdoor-rated extension cords if needed
- Ensure GFCI protection for outdoor outlets
- Protect connections from weather

### Solar power (if applicable)

<!-- TODO: Add solar setup details if supported -->
- Solar panel sizing requirements
- Charge controller recommendations
- Battery backup duration

## Installation checklist

Before finalizing installation:

- [ ] Location provides solid, stable mounting surface
- [ ] Sensor is level (verified with level tool)
- [ ] Mounting hardware is secure
- [ ] Away from vibration sources (>5 meters from machinery)
- [ ] Cellular antenna positioned for good reception
- [ ] Power cable properly routed and protected
- [ ] All cable glands sealed
- [ ] Sensor is secure against tampering/theft

## Environmental specifications

| Factor | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Operating temperature | TBD |
| Storage temperature | TBD |
| Humidity | TBD |
| Ingress protection | TBD (IP rating) |
| Wind resistance | TBD |

## Common installation mistakes

1. **Poor cellular antenna placement** - Results in connectivity issues
2. **Mounting on unstable surface** - Introduces noise into data
3. **Ignoring drainage** - Can damage electronics over time
4. **Loose mounting** - Sensor movement affects readings
5. **Cable glands not sealed** - Water ingress risk

## Next steps

Once physically installed:

1. [Install SIM card](/hardware/grillo-pulse/sim-card-setup) (if using cellular)
2. [Configure network connectivity](/hardware/grillo-pulse/network-setup)
3. [Provision the sensor](/hardware/grillo-pulse/provisioning)
