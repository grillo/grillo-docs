# What is Grillo?

Grillo is an earthquake technology company on a mission to democratize seismic monitoring and earthquake early warning.

## Our mission

<!-- TODO: Add official mission statement from grillo.io -->

Traditional seismic monitoring has been limited to well-funded institutions with expensive equipment. Grillo is changing this by providing affordable, easy-to-deploy sensors that anyone can use to build earthquake monitoring networks.

## The Grillo approach

### IoT-enabled sensors

Grillo sensors are designed from the ground up as Internet of Things (IoT) devices:

- **Affordable** - A fraction of the cost of traditional seismometers
- **Easy to deploy** - No specialized training required
- **Always connected** - Real-time data streaming to the cloud
- **Remotely managed** - Configure and update sensors from anywhere

### Distributed networks

Instead of relying on a few expensive sensors, Grillo enables dense networks of affordable sensors:

- Better coverage with more sensors
- Faster detection through proximity to events
- Community participation in monitoring
- Redundancy through distributed architecture

### Cloud-native platform

The Grillo Cloud platform (cloud.grillo.io) provides:

- Real-time sensor monitoring
- Network management tools
- Earthquake detection algorithms
- Alert distribution systems
- Data visualization and export
