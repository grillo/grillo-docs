# Connecting your Sensor
To connect your Grillo sensor to Grillo Console please follow the relevant steps for your sensor type:

:::info
If connecting by Wi-Fi or Ethernet, your local area network (LAN) must be able to dynamically assign your device an IP address by DHCP. If your network only permits for static IP addresses, please speak with your network manager to resolve this.

### Wi-Fi
The local Wi-Fi network must be 2.4Ghz (5Ghz will not work). Please ensure that 2.4Ghz is available before installing the Grillo Connect sensor in this location.

To connect the sensor you must power it on, then wait until a Wi-Fi network appears after a few seconds with an SSID that starts with `Grillo` (eg. `Grillo-XXXXXX`). Connect your phone to this network and follow these instructions.

1. On the Wi-Fi setup page, enter the SSID and Password for the local Wi-Fi network you want the sensor to connect to.
2. Enter `save` and wait for a success confirmation message.
3. After a short while, your sensor should show a blinking LED which tells you it is sending data to the cloud..

### Ethernet
Plug an ethernet cable to your sensor and in a minute or so its LED should start blinking. This means it is successfully sending data to the cloud.
