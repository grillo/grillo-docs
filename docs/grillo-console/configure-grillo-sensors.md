# Configure Grillo Sensors
From the Stations work space you are not only able to view key information about your sensor, but you can modify several properties.

## Transmission mode
Here you can tell the sensor to send continous telemetry or only on an acceleration threshold trigger.

Only use if you know which firmware you wish to use. Using this may break your device and lose connection.
