## Run development server
To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes. 
```
npm run start
```

## Build
Docusaurus is a modern static website generator so we need to build the website into a directory of static contents and put it on a web server so that it can be viewed. To build the website:
```
npm run build
```

## Updating your Docusaurus version
refer to [help pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation)

## Deploy to Github Pages

```
GIT_USER=<GITHUB_USERNAME> yarn deploy
```
