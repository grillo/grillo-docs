# Grillo Console Work Areas
Grillo console features 3 work areas: `Stations`, `Modules` and `Data`. Additional sections to manage your `account` and `billing` are located in the top right under your user name.
## Stations
In this section you can add your stations (`Grillo` sensors or through `SeedLink`), view their status and interact with some configurations.

## Modules
In this section you can add or configure modules. These can process the data from the stations and trigger actions.
